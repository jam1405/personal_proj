HOW TO USE
-run __main__.py
-main.py will create a model and viewcontroller
-the viewcontroller will start the sim and call the model to generate all positional data
-the viewcontroller will then take the total array of positions and plot them repeatedly to generate visuals

KNOWN INACCURACIES
-force and distances calculated from body centre of sun, not barycentre of solar system
-no error correction due to finite timestep
