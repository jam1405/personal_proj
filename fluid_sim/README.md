This simulation in it's current stage is from https://towardsdatascience.com/computational-fluid-dynamics-using-python-modeling-laminar-flow-272dad1ebec

Upon this framework I will be making upgrades and ultimately creating my own fluid sim.

Simply run  FlowPy_Visualizer.py to create and visualize simulation data. These will be output to a Results file.
